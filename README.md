# Twitter-spam-detection

#introduction 
Twitter spam has become a severe problem in recent years. The massive number of users and large volume of information being published on Twitter contribute significantly to the growth of spam. However, the existing machine learning-based detection algorithms are unable to accurately detect spam since the features of spam tweets change over time. This issue is called "Twitter Spam Drift". 
		In this system, Experiments were conducted on live Twitter data using KNN, SVM, and NB machine learning classifiers. Among those classifiers, SVM is showing better results, in terms of accuracy.

  # Problemâ€™s Identified 
  Spam is nothing but irrelevant or unsolicited messages sent over the internet, typically to a large number of users, for the purposes of advertising, phishing, spreading malware, etc.
In simple words spam can be defined as manipulating the platform.
Due to massive increase in the usage of twitter and sharing of data, it attracts spammers to mislead the users through retweets, URL links and hash tags.

# Aim/Objective
The main objective of this proposed system is to design a to predict drifted Twitter spam using machine learning techniques.
The major challenge is that the statistical properties of spam tweets change over time, so the existing machine learning algorithms for detecting Twitter spam cannot solve the problem of drifting Twitter spam.
So, this proposed system came up with a solution to handle the drifted spam using semi-supervised learning approach.

#Phases Of Execution 
K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN)
Naive Bayes (NB) 
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
